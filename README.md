# css-box-shadow-and-background-image
focused on enhancing elements visually using the box-shadow property and explored how to set and control background images with CSS.

## ðŸ”§ What I Practiced

- Applied the `box-shadow` property to create depth and highlight elements with a soft yellow shadow.
- Used the `background-image` property to set an image as the background of a div.
- Experimented with `background-size` using values like `cover`, `auto`, and `contain` to control how the image fits the element.

## ðŸ“„ HTML & CSS Highlights

### Box Shadow
- Created a div with:
  - `width: 200px; height: 50px;`
  - `background-color: #7aa874;`
  - `box-shadow: 1px 1px 20px yellow;`
- This creates a yellow shadow offset by 1px right and 1px down, with a blur radius of 20px, adding visual depth to the element[1].

### Background Image & Sizing
- Created a larger div with:
  - `background-image: url(b-g.jpg);`
  - `background-size: cover;`
- The `cover` value scales the image to cover the entire div, cropping if necessary. I also explored `auto` and `contain` to see how they affect the image fit[2].

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- The `box-shadow` property is useful for adding depth and making elements stand out on the page[1].
- The `background-image` property, combined with `background-size`, allows for flexible and responsive image placement within elements[2].
- Understanding how different `background-size` values work is essential for creating visually appealing backgrounds.
